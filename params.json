{"name":"WiaSane","tagline":"Scanner Access Now Easy - WIA Driver","body":"The WiaSane project provides a Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Driver\r\nwhich enables image acquisition from scanner devices through the\r\nScanner Access Now Easy (SANE) network protocol.\r\n\r\nThis WIA driver implements a SANE frontend on top of the SANE network\r\nprotocol. It is referred to as Scanner Access Now Easy - WIA Driver.\r\n\r\nIn order to access those scanner devices either the scanner itself or\r\na SANE daemon needs to provide a SANE network frontend to be used.\r\n\r\nDownloads can either be found on the corresponding [wiki page](https://github.com/mback2k/wiasane/wiki/Downloads)\r\nor on the [release overview](https://github.com/mback2k/wiasane/releases).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nIn order to use the SANE device created by this driver you will need to\r\nmake use of a WIA-compatible scanning application. Examples include:\r\n- [Windows Fax and Scan](http://bit.ly/windowsfaxandscan)\r\n- [Not Another PDF Scanner 2](http://sourceforge.net/projects/naps2/)\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nThis software is currently build and tested against Windows 7.\r\nThe required Windows API functions are available since Windows Vista,\r\nwhich means that it could work on Windows Vista and newer versions.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n- Create a Windows scanner device by connecting to a SANE device\r\n- Support for color, grayscale and lineart/threshold scan modes\r\n- Support for preview and final scan types\r\n- Support for contrast and brightness settings\r\n- Support for single-sided scanning from a flatbed\r\n- Support for automatic document feeder and duplex mode\r\n- Integrated property page for device modification\r\n- Integrated wizard during driver/device installation\r\n\r\nTo be implemented\r\n-----------------\r\n- Support for username- und password-based authentication (in progress)\r\n\r\nTo be improved\r\n--------------\r\n- Make WIA driver use asynchronous network connections\r\n- Make wizard and property pages use threaded device I/O handling\r\n- Handling of rounding issues while converting between units of length\r\n- Handling of errors while using automatic document feeder or duplex mode\r\n\r\nDevelopment and Build environment\r\n---------------------------------\r\nPlease find this information on the [GitHub project](https://github.com/mback2k/wiasane).\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 - 2014, Marc Hoersken, <info@marc-hoersken.de>\r\n\r\nThis software is licensed as described in the file COPYING, which\r\nyou should have received as part of this software distribution.\r\n\r\nAll trademarks are the property of their respective owners.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
